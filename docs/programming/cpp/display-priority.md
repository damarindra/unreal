Set the priority on your details panel is so important when you inheriting other classes. Sometimes, you need to make a property that must be below some other property from the base class. For example, I made a script that inherits from `CharacterMovementComponent` and I want to place my `SprintSpeed` right after `WalkSpeed`. The latest property will always result on the bottom, you can re-order this using UProperty option.

## UPROPERTY

| Property                    |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Details |
| :-------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------: |
| DisplayAfter="PropertyName" |                                                                             This property will show up in the Blueprint Editor immediately after the property named PropertyName, regardless of its order in source code, as long as both properties are in the same category. If multiple properties have the same DisplayAfter value and the same DisplayPriority value, they will appear after the named property in the order in which they are declared in the header file. |
| DisplayPriority="N"         | If two properties feature the same DisplayAfter value, or are in the same category and do not have the DisplayAfter Meta Tag, this property will determine their sorting order. The highest-priority value is 1, meaning that a property with a DisplayPriority value of 1 will appear above a property with a DisplayProirity value of 2. If multiple properties have the same DisplayAfter value, they will appear in the order in which they are declared in the header file. |

## UCLASS

| Property                              |                                                                                                                                                                                                                        Details |

| HideCategories=(Category1, Category2) | Lists one or more categories that should be hidden from the user entirely. To hide properties declared with no category, use the name of the class which declares the variable. This Specifier is propagated to child classes. |
