Mixamo is a resource for your prototype game! But, did you know that it doesn't support for unreal? Don't worry, some guy create a plugin for blender to convert mixamo animation into Unreal humanoid skeleton animation. You can find [it in here](https://github.com/enziop/mixamo_converter).

This page created for listing animation names, so you don't need to find it one by one.
